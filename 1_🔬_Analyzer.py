Kind of made it seem like the record label just went cheap, which is a disservice to anyone that actually listens to their vinyl...This ‚ÄúGreatest Hits‚Äù compilation did not have the same problems as the other two I bought. It sounded as it should have, and there were no skips.",

King has always genuinely impressed me with his incredible eye for detail, his sense of place, and his ability to steadily pay out the rope line of a story's plot. Additionally, of course, he's the Jedi Master of creepiness. Although I was familiar with the premise of ‚ÄúThe Stand‚Äù, it still scared me a lot",
